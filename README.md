A self-hosted NetDevOps platform for network operations management, featuring IP Address Management (IPAM), inventory management, and script automation capabilities.

## Features

### IPAM (IP Address Management)
- Create and manage subnets with CIDR validation
- Allocate and track IP addresses within subnets
- Automatic subnet scanning using nmap to discover active hosts
- Track IP address status (active/available), hostname, and MAC address

### Script Runner
- Upload and manage Python (`.py`), Bash (`.sh`), and PowerShell (`.ps1`) scripts
- Execute scripts locally on the server or remotely via SSH/WinRM
- Support for script arguments
- Real-time capture of stdout/stderr logs
- Execution status tracking (pending, running, success, failure, cancelled)
- Ability to stop running executions

### Inventory Management (GLPI-like)
- Complete equipment management: servers, switches, routers, firewalls, workstations, etc.
- Manufacturer and brand management with website links
- Equipment models with specifications (JSON)
- Equipment types with custom icons
- Location hierarchy: Site > Building > Room
- Supplier management with contact details
- Full tracking: serial number, asset tag, purchase date, warranty expiry
- Equipment status: In Service, In Stock, Retired, Maintenance
- Bidirectional IP-Equipment linking with IPAM integration

### Network Topology
- Visual network topology display showing subnets and IP addresses
- Color-coded visualization (green for active IPs, gray for available)

### Dashboard
- Statistics overview: total subnets, active IPs, scripts, executions, and equipment
- System status monitoring
- Quick action buttons for common tasks

### User Management
- User authentication with JWT tokens
- Role-based access control (admin/user)
- Granular permissions (IPAM, Topology, Scripts, Settings, Inventory)
- Admin can create and delete users
- Password validation (minimum 8 characters)

### Security
- JWT-based authentication with configurable secret
- CORS protection with configurable origins
- Rate limiting on login endpoint
- Path traversal protection for file uploads
- Input validation and sanitization

### Internationalization
- Full support for English and French
- Language preference persisted across sessions
